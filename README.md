# SPS Game - Stone Paper Scissors

This is a simple Stone-Paper-Scissors game written in C++ as a **Console Application**.

## About This Project

This is my very first project, created as a way to practice C++ programming.  
I finished it in about 5 hours yesterday,  and today just fixed some major bugs (lol).  
It might still have some mistakes, but I'm proud to share it with you!

## How to Run

1. Open the solution file `Project_Stone-Paber-Scissor.sln` in **Visual Studio 2022**.
2. Build the project by clicking **Build > Build Solution** or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B`.
3. Run the program by pressing **F5** or clicking **Debug > Start Debugging**.
4. The game will run in the **console window**. Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

## Game Description

You play against the computer by choosing Stone (1), Paper (2), or Scissors (3).  
The game goes on for the number of rounds you select at the beginning.  
The winner is whoever wins the most rounds.

## Notes

- The program uses console colors to highlight different results.
- Make sure to run it in a console that supports colors.
- Feedback, tips, and suggestions are always welcome!
